I learn Computational Geometry only for Computer Graphics😁. Chapter 6, 10, 16 describe techniques for 2d graphics, typical questions involve the intersection of primitives, determining the primitive pointed to the mouse or determining the subset of primitives that lies within a particular region. Chapter 12 is about 3d graphics. We will learn an approach to discard the parts behind other objects.
